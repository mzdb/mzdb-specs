Specifications of the mzDB file format.

The main document describing the mzDB specifications is named "mzDB_x.x.x_specifications.docx", "x.x.x" being the version number of the corresponding specifications. This document is also provided in the PDF format.
For each version of the specifications, a dedicated folder has been created.

This folder contains some other documents for developers who prefer to have access to database diagram or script:

* mzDB_x.x.x_schema_documentation.html => the HTML documentation of the schema (as exported from PowerArchitect)
* mzDB_x.x.x_schema_picture.pdf => the picture of the schema in PDF format (as exported from PowerArchitect)
* mzDB_x.x.x_schema_script.sql => the SQLite script used for mzDB schema initialization
